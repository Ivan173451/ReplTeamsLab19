<p id="demo">I honestly love doing tasks online and having this class as my shop is wonderful. I feel motivated and look forward to coming to it. In the future I don't know where I'll be and I can't imagine myself anywhere either, but I do hope I'm doing something I love that is related to the things I learn in this class. In web design you have control over everything which I think is why I like it so much.</p>
